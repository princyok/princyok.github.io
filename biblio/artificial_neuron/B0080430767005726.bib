abstract = "Frank Rosenblatt, a psychologist at Cornell University's Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory, gave the name Perceptrons to a family of theoretical and experimental neural network models for pattern classification and information storage which he proposed and investigated in the period 1957â€“1962. This article briefly references the work in brain modeling, automata studies, probabilistic learning theories and statistical classification which provided the context for Rosenblatt's work, summarizes the basic operations of a simple perceptron, and comments on work on Perceptrons since Rosenblatt."
